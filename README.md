Email Processor
==========================================

The code contained in this module provides a way to process an email inbox using the JavaMail API.

It's very basic right now, but hopefully more functionality is on the way.

Future improvements include:
-----------------------------------------
* plugin-type email processing rules (right now, there is just one)
* ability to set a polling time
* integrate Spring into the current code
